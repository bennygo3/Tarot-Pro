                <p class="about1">
                    My name is Xiamara Chupaflor and I am a bruja of Apache/Comanche descent living
                    in the Mexican border people's diaspora. I am a second-generation
                    hustler, punk-lifer, queer, writer, mixed media collage artist and mediator. I am currently
                    based in so called New Orleans, Louisiana occupied Chitimacha territory, Bulbancha. I was
                    born to the West Texas desert, the Permian Basin, occupied Apache territory.
                </p>
                <p class="about2">
                    Since 2009 I have dedicated myself to honing my channeling skills through tarot divination and
                    creating elaborate altars, intuiting my way through spells and candle magic using my tarot cards to
                    guide my personal practices and create and maintain relationships with my ancestors, deities and spirit
                    guides. I identify as a messenger, a seer and a conduit between the spirit world and the world we
                    presently live in, with the gifts of clairaudience, clairsentience and claircognizance.
                </p>
                <p class="about3">
                    In addition, i have had the privilege of being a CNA for end of life care, a caregiver and educator
                    for folks living with disabilities, a social worker, a resident caregiver in a long-term harm reduction-based
                    housing project and mediator for my community. I also founded and created Brown Recluse Zine Distro, an online
                    platform for Black and Brown writers to distribute their writing projects.
                </p>
                <p class="about4">
                    My perspectives and mission as a tarot guide are an extension of all of the skilled caregiving work
                    that I have spent the better part of twenty years developing alongside my life experiences as a queer
                    Brown woman living in the diaspora. I have been lucky that each path has led me to the next, my
                    intuition and charisma lighting the way. Each job, project and community care endeavor taught me about magic and taught me
                    a host of skills through repetition and ritual and being entrusted with people when they are their most vulnerable
                    selves.
                </p>
                <p class="about5">
                    My practice is centered in transformative justice work through spiritual self-awareness and
                    emotional regulation. My accumulated skill sets and experience have informed how I approach tarot: with compassion and
                    honesty. I have a unique gift to create a bridge between a person and their personal unknowns. My desire is to carve out space for
                    people's multiple truths and vulnerabilities, especially for those like myself, people who live at the intersections of
                    structural violence.
                </p>
                <p class="about6">
                    I am a collage and mixed media artist, using only original clippings and media, choosing to work
                    with non-digital media: paper, found objects, old print media and books, glitter, lace, fabric, herbs, scissors and glue. I
                    thoroughly enjoy the methodical patience it takes to find images, objects, colors and other media to piece together a cohesive piece
                    of work. My work often features esoteric ad mystic themes that resonate with my personal journey. Alongside tarot and a
                    mixed media collage artist, I am a writer spending many years traveling with Brown Recluse Zine Distro speaking about DIY and punk
                    vehicles of expression. All of my practices are based in the idea that you can turn trash into treasure.
