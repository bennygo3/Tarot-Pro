            <p>
                Tarot is one of the many tools we can use to navigate the numan experience. Tarot creates a road map for potentials and forges
                paths at the edge of the unknown. Tarot is my chosen tool to bridge spirit to the querent. My mission and my work are centered in connection.
                Connection with Spirit and connection with Self and to understand how to use your own brilliance and the tools available to you to create and achieve
                the movement you desire in life.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                My offerings are simple, channeled tarot guidance and divination. i offer a variety of different structures for tarot guidance ranging from short and sweet
                three card pulls to more elaborate spreads that are more conducive for big life transitions or to compliment your deeper spiritual work.
            </p>

            <p>
                I  believe that healing should be accessible. I want to remove my offerings from the capitalist machine as much as possible. I offer sliding scale sessions and 
                sponsored readings for QTIBIPOC. This means that if you fall under the QTIBIPOC umbrella and are having a financial hardship I will locate money for you to receive 
                a reading that you don’t have to pay for. Everyone deserves access to healing and everyone needs to receive compensation for their gifts to survive in this world. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Also presented here is my collage art, mixed media art and other art collaborations as well as my writing about a variety of topics relating to studying, understanding 
                and interpreting tarot and how it relates to a variety of topics relating to tarot, mysticism and manifestation, emotional regulation, spiritual and emotional 
                health, decolonial and anti-capitalist politics and how all these concepts relate to modern magic and tarot.

            <h1>TESTIMONIALS</h1>
           
            <p>
                “I still come back to the guiding and grounding tarot reading Xiamara gave me at the beginning of quarantine. What Xiamara wields is not merely a gift, 
                but a testament to her study and diligence to tarot as a holy teacher. I left my session with her with a rounded sense of how my past left my present 
                and how my present should feed my future. She’s a total time traveler comfortably weaving through portals, assisting us in closing 
                and opening what’s asking to come through.” — Clara, SEATTLE, WASHINGTON
            </p>

            <p>
                “Xiamara’s readings are honest tough love and that is vital to healing from my anxiety. No froofy empty promises; but rigid important lessons. 
                Not only does she give an insightful amazing reading, she it protective of how she transfers information so our anxieties and 
                colonizer ancestors do not get the best of us when we are trying to hold onto the knowledge we were just offered.”
                — Cristy Road, BROOKLYN, NEW YORK
            </p>

            <p>
                “The reading I received from Xiamara was lean, strong and stabilizing. Through it, I was able to reconnect with a few beloved ancestors and 
                felt spiritually supported in my current iteration of healing. The reading left me grateful and curious.”
                — Gabriel, AKRON, OHIO
            </p>

            <p>
                “Have gotten two readings from Xiamara and each time I have left them with insights that I have thought about for weeks after. Xiamara is 
                naturally intuitive and as she reads your cards you sense how connected she is with the spirit world. I appreciate people who are real with me, 
                pull no punches, but are also able to communicate these things with me ways that motivate me both to look inward and also be thoughtful about what 
                my next moves will be, whether big or small. Xiamara does these things for me in her readings and I have definitely taken them into consideration afterwards. 
                I am a quick tempered person and her readings have often steered me into thinking of a bigger spiritual picture rather than being reactive.”
                — Khristina, PHILADELPHIA, PA
            </p>

            <p>
                “What a gift to get a reading from Chupaflor Divination. The experience is both grounded and ethereal: the beauty with which Xiamara sets up the experience, 
                the exquisite intentionality of every object, and the presence which Xiamara brings to the moment. She embodies both power and grace as she reads the cards, 
                culling spirits and focusing her skill. I got a reading this past July, right before I was to embark on a large life transition, moving away and starting school. 
                I had so much anxiety about moving forward and what were the right steps to take. But everything in my reading set me on the right path: I followed the suggestions 
                that had been laid out before me and I found everything set into place, setting me up for a bright new beginning. I had been so nervous beforehand, scared I would be 
                told something that didn’t sit right or felt off the mark—but instead, everything relieved me, it was just what I needed to hear, but something I could not see without outside help. 
                I’m so grateful for the insight and wisdom. I cannot recommend a Chupaflor reading enough. ”
                — Zibby, PROVIDENCE, RI
            </p>

            <p>
                “Xiamara provides so much grounding, wisdom and insight with each reading. She has multiple times prepared me for major life events/changes that I otherwise wouldn’t have seen coming. 
                Xiamara is so passionate and this is exuded in the words she shares with you. You can’ help but step away feeling recharged and inspired to deal with the next steps in life, regardless 
                of how difficult they may be. She is intuitive and caring but doesn’t shy away from hard truths that need to be heard. I highly recommend one of her readings to support your deepest growth 
                and healing.”
                — Kim, VANCOUVER BC
